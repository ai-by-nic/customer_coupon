# Coupon Acceptance Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis of customer behaviors related to coupon acceptance. The primary focus is on understanding the key differences between customers who accepted coffee house and bar coupons versus those who did not. The findings provide insights into demographic, social, and economic factors influencing coupon redemption rates.

## Summary of Findings

### Coffee House Coupons

Customers who accepted coffee house coupons tend to be:

- **Frequent coffee shop visitors** – Those visiting 1-3 times per month or more were significantly more likely to accept.
- **Younger individuals (21-24 years old)** – This age group had the highest acceptance rate (52.43%).
- **Social consumers** – Drivers traveling with a passenger (friends or a partner) had higher acceptance rates (~58%).
- **Certain occupations influenced acceptance** – Healthcare and maintenance workers showed the highest acceptance rates (~74%).
- **Income-level variations** – Higher acceptance was seen in both high-income earners ($87,500–$99,999) and the lowest income group (<$12,500), while middle-income groups had lower acceptance.

Customers who did not accept coffee house coupons were more likely to:

- Visit coffee shops less frequently.
- Work in occupations with lower engagement in promotional offers (e.g., production, community services).
- Belong to the middle-income group ($62,500–$87,499), suggesting greater price sensitivity.

### Bar Coupons

Customers who accepted bar coupons tend to be:

- **Frequent bar-goers** – Those who regularly visit bars had a much higher acceptance rate (76.88%) than occasional visitors (52.74%).
- **Younger individuals (under 30 years old)** – This group had the highest acceptance rate (73.13%).
- **Social drinkers** – Drivers with a passenger (excluding children) were significantly more likely to accept bar coupons (71.79%).
- **Not necessarily low-income** – Unlike coffee house coupons, lower-income frequent restaurant-goers had a lower acceptance rate (43.84%).

Customers who did not accept bar coupons were more likely to:

- Visit bars infrequently.
- Have children in the car, indicating family-oriented drivers are less likely to engage with bar promotions.
- Show financial caution despite frequenting restaurants.

## Recommendations

For **marketing strategies**, the following approaches may improve coupon redemption:

- **Coffee House Coupons:** Target frequent visitors and younger individuals with mobile coupons and loyalty-based rewards.
- **Bar Coupons:** Focus on social drinkers over 25, avoiding drivers with kids in the car.
- **Segmenting by income & occupation:** Tailor campaigns for high-acceptance demographics, such as healthcare workers for coffee promotions.
- **Testing different discount amounts:** Investigate whether larger discounts improve acceptance among middle-income groups.

## Future Analysis

Potential areas for further research include:

- The impact of external factors (e.g., time of day, weekday vs. weekend) on coupon acceptance.
- Crossover behavior—determining if customers who accept one type of coupon (e.g., coffee shop) are also likely to accept another (e.g., restaurant or bar).
- Statistical validation of differences using hypothesis testing.

This analysis provides a data-driven perspective on consumer behavior regarding promotional offers. Further refinements can optimize coupon strategies based on customer tendencies and preferences.
